This is a Linear regression problem solver, it also has a graphical component.

it's really useful for analysis when you are working with artificial inteligence in a very basic level
also is really easy to use because it have a procedural working process, doesn't need a menu to work.

developed in in Linux-Based operating systems, not tested in Microsoft windows operating systems yet.

### HOW TO EXECUTE IT?

0- Download it.

1- Open a terminal.

2- Run the following command.

    python3 Lin-R3G.py

3- load your data in the program.

### SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF THE RESULTS.

firts we will take some data to work with, in this case i will use a table with X data and Y data
then we will get the graph for the interpolated data, then we will see how the iterative process run over those
dots showing the polynomial regression.

This is the data that we're gonna use.
X data array: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Y data array: 2.1, 7.7, 13.6, 27.2, 40.9, 61.1
number of iterations is given by the X and Y array length value, in this case is 6.
