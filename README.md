This is a Linear regression problem solver, it also has a graphical component.

it's really useful for analysis when you are working with artificial inteligence in a very basic level
also is really easy to use because it have a procedural working process, doesn't need a menu to work.

developed in in Linux-Based operating systems, not tested in Microsoft windows operating systems yet.

### HOW TO EXECUTE IT?

0- Download it.

1- Open a terminal.

2- Run the following command.

    python3 Lin-R3G.py

3- load your data in the program.

### SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF THE RESULTS.

firts we will take some data to work with, in this case i will use a table with X data and Y data
then we will get the graph for the interpolated data, then we will see how the iterative process run over those
dots showing the polynomial regression.
